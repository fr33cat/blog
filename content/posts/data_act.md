Key elements of the data act:

- Development of new services
- Facilitate the development of new services in the sector of artificial intelligence, where huge amounts of data are needed for algorithm training.
- ==Lower the prices for after-sales services and repairs of connected devices==
- Grant access to data by public institutions in case of emergency 
- Facilitate switching from one cloud provider to another
- Prevent unlawful international data transfers by cloud providers



Example: a car manufacturer is collecting many data from the usage of the car, this data is often used by the manufacturer. The Data Act requires that the data is available for other services providers so the owner of the car can get other services by sharing his data with those third parties. This is supposed to facilitate small and medium companies participating in providing services.

Sharing data becomes an <u>obligation</u> and it is not an 'option' anymore. 

Sharing data with governments will be done by respecting all democratic rights, so authorities cannot use this data on regular bases. Only very specific emergency situations will allow public authorities accessing to all this data.
