The goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks, denial of service, information disclosure, or authentication bypass.\nIn this blog post, we will show you how to perform API fuzzing on AWS EC2 using a tool called aws-fuzz. Aws-fuzz is a Python script that leverages the boto3 library to interact with AWS services and generate fuzzed requests. It supports various AWS services, including EC2.\nPrerequisites #  To use aws-fuzz, you need to have the following:\n Python 3 and pip installed on your system An AWS account with access keys configured The boto3 library installed (pip install boto3) The aws-fuzz script downloaded from here  Usage #  To use aws-fuzz, you need to specify the service name, the operation name, and optionally some parameters. For example, to fuzz the DescribeInstances operation of EC2, you can run:\npython aws_fuzz.py ec2 DescribeInstances\nThis will generate random values for all the parameters of the operation and send them to the EC2 endpoint. You can also specify some parameters manually by using the -p option. For example:\npython aws_fuzz.py ec2 DescribeInstances -p InstanceIds=i-1234567890abcdef0\nThis will use the given value for InstanceIds and fuzz the rest of the parameters.\nYou can also specify multiple operations by using a comma-separated list. For example:\npython aws_fuzz.py ec2 DescribeInstances,RunInstances\nThis will fuzz both operations in sequence.\nThe output of aws-fuzz will show you the request details and the response status code and body. You can also enable verbose mode by using -v option to see more details about each request.\nTips #  Here are some tips for using aws-fuzz effectively:\n Use a test account or a test region to avoid affecting your production resources Monitor your AWS usage and billing to avoid unexpected charges Review your CloudTrail logs to see what actions were performed by aws-fuzz Use filters or tags to limit the scope of your fuzzing targets Analyze the responses for any errors or anomalies that indicate a vulnerability  Conclusion #  API fuzzing is a useful technique for pentesting AWS EC2 and other services. By using aws-fuzz, you can easily generate and send fuzzed requests to AWS endpoints and discover potential security issues. Remember to follow best practices and be responsible when performing pentesting on AWS.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/aws/lambda/","title":"Lambda","section":"AWS","content":"How to Pentest AWS Lambda Functions #  AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda functions can be triggered by various events, such as HTTP requests, S3 bucket changes, DynamoDB streams, etc. Lambda functions can also access other AWS services and resources through IAM roles and policies.\nPentesting AWS Lambda functions can be challenging, as they are ephemeral, scalable, and isolated. However, there are some techniques that can help you discover and exploit vulnerabilities in Lambda functions and their configurations.\nDiscovering Lambda Functions #  One of the first steps in pentesting AWS Lambda functions is to find out which functions exist and how they are invoked. There are several ways to do this:\n Use the AWS CLI or SDK to list all the functions in a region: aws lambda list-functions --region \u0026lt;region\u0026gt; Use the AWS Management Console to browse through the functions and their triggers Use tools like Lambhack or Pacu to enumerate Lambda functions and their metadata Use passive reconnaissance techniques such as DNS enumeration, subdomain scanning, web crawling, etc. to find endpoints that invoke Lambda functions Use active reconnaissance techniques such as port scanning, banner grabbing, fuzzing, etc. to identify Lambda function endpoints and their parameters  Exploiting Lambda Functions #  Once you have discovered some Lambda functions and their triggers, you can try to exploit them by sending malicious inputs or requests. Some of the common attack vectors are:\n Injection attacks: If the Lambda function accepts user input or parameters from an event source (such as API Gateway), you can try to inject malicious code or commands that will execute on the underlying container or environment. For example, you can use Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) techniques to execute arbitrary code on a function that uses a templating engine (such as Jinja2) for rendering HTML responses. Privilege escalation attacks: If the Lambda function has an IAM role attached to it that grants access to other AWS resources or services (such as S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, EC2 instances, etc.), you can try to abuse those permissions by performing unauthorized actions on those resources or services. For example, you can use Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) techniques to make requests from the function\u0026rsquo;s container to internal AWS endpoints (such as metadata service) that will return sensitive information (such as IAM credentials) that you can use for further exploitation. Denial-of-service attacks: If the Lambda function has a limited concurrency limit or timeout value set for it (which is common for cost optimization purposes), you can try to exhaust those limits by sending multiple concurrent requests or long-running requests that will prevent other legitimate requests from being processed. For example, you can use Slowloris tool to send partial HTTP requests that will keep connections open with the function\u0026rsquo;s endpoint until it reaches its concurrency limit.  Mitigating Risks #  To prevent or reduce the impact of pentesting attacks on AWS Lambda functions, there are some best practices that should be followed by developers and administrators:\n Use secure coding practices and frameworks when developing Lambda functions Validate and sanitize user input and parameters before processing them Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms for debugging purposes Restrict access to Lambda function endpoints using authentication and authorization mechanisms (such as API keys) Apply least privilege principle when assigning IAM roles and policies to Lambda functions Monitor and audit Lambda function activity using CloudWatch Logs and CloudTrail  "},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/aws/s3/","title":"S3","section":"AWS","content":"How to Find and Exploit Misconfigured S3 Buckets #  Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a popular cloud storage service that allows users to store and retrieve objects from anywhere on the web. However, S3 buckets can also be a source of security vulnerabilities if they are not configured properly. In this blog post, we will show you how to find and exploit misconfigured S3 buckets using some common tools and techniques.\nFinding S3 Buckets #  One of the first steps in pentesting AWS S3 is to identify potential targets. There are several ways to find S3 buckets, such as:\n Using public tools like Grayhat Warfare or Bucket Stream that scan for publicly accessible buckets Using subdomain enumeration tools like Amass or Subfinder that can reveal bucket names based on DNS records Using wordlists or brute force tools like AWSBucketDump or S3Scanner that can guess bucket names based on common patterns Using metadata analysis tools like FOCA or Metagoofil that can extract bucket names from documents or images hosted on S3  Once you have a list of potential bucket names, you can use the AWS CLI tool or a web browser to check if they exist and what permissions they have. For example, using the AWS CLI tool, you can run the following command:\naws s3 ls s3://bucket-name --no-sign-request\nThis will list the contents of the bucket if it exists and is publicly readable. If you get an error message like Access Denied or AllAccessDisabled, it means that the bucket either does not exist or is not publicly accessible.\nExploiting S3 Buckets #  Depending on the permissions of the bucket, you may be able to perform different actions on it, such as:\n  Reading objects: If the bucket has ListObjects and GetObject permissions enabled for everyone, you can download any object from it using the AWS CLI tool or a web browser. For example:\naws s3 cp s3://bucket-name/object-name . --no-sign-request\nThis will copy the object to your current directory.\n  Writing objects: If the bucket has PutObject permission enabled for everyone, you can upload any object to it using the AWS CLI tool or a web browser. For example:\naws s3 cp local-file s3://bucket-name/object-name --no-sign-request\nThis will upload your local file to the bucket with the specified name.\n  Deleting objects: If the bucket has DeleteObject permission enabled for everyone, you can delete any object from it using the AWS CLI tool or a web browser. For example:\naws s3 rm s3://bucket-name/object-name --no-sign-request\nThis will delete the object from the bucket.\n  Modifying permissions: If the bucket has PutBucketAcl permission enabled for everyone, you can change its access control list (ACL) using the AWS CLI tool or a web browser. For example:\naws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket bucket-name --acl private --no-sign-request\nThis will make the bucket private and remove any public access.\n  Exploiting misconfigured S3 buckets can lead to various impacts, such as data leakage, data tampering, data loss, denial of service, or even code execution if malicious files are uploaded and executed by other services that use S3 as a source.\nConclusion #  AWS S3 is a widely used cloud storage service that offers many benefits but also poses many risks if not configured properly. As pentesters, we should always look for misconfigured S3 buckets as part of our reconnaissance and exploitation phases. As defenders, we should always follow best practices for securing our S3 buckets and monitor them regularly for any unauthorized access.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/python-snippets/asymetric-encryption/","title":"Asymetric Encryption","section":"Python Snippets","content":"Using Public/Private Key Pairs for Encryption and Decryption with Python #  In this blog post, we’ll take a look at how to use the cryptography library in Python to generate a public/private key pair and use them for encryption and decryption.\nThe cryptography library provides a simple and easy-to-use API for performing common cryptographic operations. In our example script, we use the rsa module from the cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric package to generate a public/private key pair and perform RSA encryption with OAEP padding.\nFirst, we generate a private/public key pair using the rsa.generate_private_key() method. We then serialize the private key to PEM format using the private_key.private_bytes() method. This allows us to save the private key to disk or transmit it over a network.\nNext, we demonstrate how to load a private key from PEM format using the serialization.load_pem_private_key() method. This allows us to load a previously generated private key from disk or receive it over a network.\nOnce we have our public/private key pair, we can use them to encrypt and decrypt messages. In our example script, we encrypt a simple “Hello World!” message using the public key and then decrypt it again using the private key.\nThis is just one example of how you can use Python for cryptography tasks. There are many other libraries available that provide more advanced functionality for encryption, decryption, hashing, digital signatures, etc.\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes # Generate a private/public key pair private_key = rsa.generate_private_key( public_exponent=65537, key_size=2048, ) public_key = private_key.public_key() # Serialize the private key to PEM format pem = private_key.private_bytes( encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM, format=serialization.PrivateFormat.PKCS8, encryption_algorithm=serialization.NoEncryption() ) # Load a private key from PEM format private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key( pem, password=None, ) # Encrypt a message using the public key message = b\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34; encrypted_message = public_key.encrypt( message, padding.OAEP( mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()), algorithm=hashes.SHA256(), label=None ) ) # Decrypt the message using the private key decrypted_message = private_key.decrypt( encrypted_message, padding.OAEP( mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()), algorithm=hashes.SHA256(), label=None ) ) This code will use the rsa module from the cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric package to generate a public/private key pair.

EWS stands for Exchange Web Services and is a web service that allows you to access various features of Microsoft Exchange Server such as calendars, contacts, tasks, etc.\nTo use EWS from Python, you need to install a third-party library called exchangelib. You can install it using pip:\npip install exchangelib Then, you need to import it and create an Account object with your credentials and server details.
