<p>Cybersecurity News: Hitachi Energy Breached by Clop Gang Through Zero-Day Exploitation</p>
<p>Hitachi Energy, a global leader in power grid solutions and renewable energy technologies, has disclosed a data breach that occurred on March 16, 2023. The company said that it was targeted by the Clop ransomware gang, which exploited a zero-day vulnerability in GoAnywhere, a secure file transfer solution used by Hitachi Energy.</p>
<p>According to Hitachi Energy, the attackers gained access to some of its files and encrypted them with Clop ransomware. The company also said that some of its data was leaked online by the hackers, who demanded a ransom for its decryption and deletion.</p>
<p>Hitachi Energy immediately launched an investigation into the incident and disconnected the compromised system. The company reported the data breach to law enforcement agencies and data protection watchdogs. It also said that it was working with external experts to restore its operations and prevent further damage.</p>
<p>The company assured its customers and partners that it was taking all necessary steps to protect their data and interests. It also apologized for any inconvenience caused by the breach and thanked them for their support and understanding.</p>
<p>The Clop ransomware gang is known for targeting large organizations with sophisticated attacks. In recent months, it has hit several high-profile victims, including Accellion, Qualys, Shell, Bombardier, Flagstar Bank, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Miami Health System, Stanford University School of Medicine and more.</p>
<p>The GoAnywhere zero-day vulnerability exploited by Clop is a serious threat to any organization that uses this software for secure file transfers. According to Mandiant FireEye researchers who analyzed the attack on Hitachi Energy, the vulnerability allows remote code execution on vulnerable servers without authentication.</p>
<p>Mandiant FireEye said that it had notified GoAnywhere&rsquo;s developer HelpSystems about the flaw on March 17th and provided technical details to help them fix it. HelpSystems confirmed that it was working on a patch and advised its customers to update their software as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This incident highlights the importance of cybersecurity for any organization that relies on digital technologies for its operations. It also shows how quickly cybercriminals can exploit new vulnerabilities and cause significant damage. Therefore, organizations should always monitor their systems for any signs of compromise, apply security updates promptly and have backup plans in case of an attack.</p>
